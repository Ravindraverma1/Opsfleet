To integrate Kubernetes with AWS Secret Manager and HashiCorp Vault, you'll use a tool called the Kubernetes Secrets Store CSI Driver. Here's how you can set it up:

Install the CSI Driver:
First, you need to add the Kubernetes Secrets Store CSI Driver to your Kubernetes cluster. This tool helps Kubernetes connect to external secret management systems like AWS Secret Manager and HashiCorp Vault.

Set Up Secrets Providers:
After installing the CSI Driver, you'll need to tell it how to talk to AWS Secret Manager and HashiCorp Vault. Each provider has its own settings, like access credentials and URLs. You'll give this info to the CSI Driver so it can connect to these services.

Create Secrets:
Now, you'll make your secrets in AWS Secret Manager and HashiCorp Vault. These secrets can be things like passwords, API keys, or certificates. They're the sensitive bits of info your apps need to run securely.

Access Secrets from Pods:
Once your secrets are stored in AWS Secret Manager and HashiCorp Vault, Kubernetes can grab them for your pods. You don't have to worry about putting secrets directly in your pod's config. Kubernetes will manage getting them when needed.

Update Pod Configs:
You'll tweak your pod's config files to say which secrets to use from AWS or Vault. The CSI Driver helps Kubernetes find these secrets without you needing to change your app's code.


example : 

apiVersion: secrets-store.csi.x-k8s.io/v1alpha1
kind: SecretProviderClass
metadata:
  name: aws-secrets
spec:
  provider: aws
  parameters:                    # provider-specific parameters
    objects:  |
     - objectName: "MySecret2"
        objectType: "secretsmanager"

spec: Specifies the configuration details for the SecretProviderClass.

provider: Specifies the provider for this SecretProviderClass, which is aws. It indicates that this class will be used to retrieve secrets from AWS.

we can replace provider here with the vault
provider: vault

1. Terraform Workspaces:
a)Terraform workspaces provide a way to manage multiple distinct sets of Terraform state files within the same configuration. Each workspace can have its own set of resources defined in Terraform files and it is very useful for managing environments such as development, staging, and production.
b) commands like terraform workspace new <workspace_name> to create a new workspace, and terraform workspace select <workspace_name> to switch to an existing one.
c) When you apply changes with terraform apply, Terraform automatically uses the state associated with the current workspace.

2. Configuration Folder Structure:
Need to create a separate folder for each environment (e.g., dev, stage, prod), and within each folder, you'd place Terraform configuration files (*.tf) along with environment-specific variable files (terraform.tfvars).
commands : terraform apply --var-file=config/dev/terraform.tfvars
