Given the client's setup with Kubernetes on AWS (EKS + Terraform) and their current practice of storing secrets in configuration files alongside the code in GitHub, here are one or two options for improving the management of sensitive data:

## AWS Secrets Manager Integration:

Utilize AWS Secrets Manager to securely store and manage sensitive data such as database passwords.
Configure the application to retrieve secrets dynamically from AWS Secrets Manager at runtime.
Implement AWS IAM roles and policies to control access to secrets, ensuring only authorized entities can retrieve them.
Use environment variables or Kubernetes secrets to securely pass the retrieved secrets to the application pods.

Advantages:
AWS Secrets Manager provides a centralized and managed solution for secret storage.
Integration with IAM allows for fine-grained access control.
No need for self-hosted solutions, as AWS manages Secrets Manager.

Considerations:
Ensure proper IAM permissions are set up to allow the application to access Secrets Manager.
Monitor and audit access to secrets for security compliance.

## HashiCorp Vault Integration:
Implement HashiCorp Vault for secure secret management.
Utilize Vault's Kubernetes authentication method to authenticate Kubernetes service accounts and pods.
Store sensitive data in Vault's encrypted storage backend, such as KeyValue secrets engine or Transit secrets engine.
Configure the application to authenticate with Vault and retrieve secrets dynamically at runtime.

Advantages:
HashiCorp Vault offers extensive features for secret management, including encryption, dynamic secrets, and access control.
Integration with Kubernetes allows for seamless authentication and access to secrets for application pods.
Vault can be deployed on AWS or any other infrastructure, providing flexibility.

Considerations:
Requires additional setup and management compared to AWS Secrets Manager.
Ensure proper access control policies are defined in Vault to restrict access to secrets based on roles and responsibilities.
Regularly audit and rotate secrets to maintain security.
Both options provide robust solutions for managing sensitive data securely in a Kubernetes environment on AWS. The choice between AWS Secrets Manager and HashiCorp Vault depends on factors such as existing infrastructure, security requirements, and familiarity with the tools within the client's team.
